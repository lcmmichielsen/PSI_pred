# Predicting cell-type-specific PSI values

This GitHub repository can be used to reproduce the results to predict cell-type-specific PSI values using long-read single-cell sequencing data. Information on how to train linear regression (LR) and deep learning (DL) models can be found in the corresponding folders. How to analyze the results and reproduce the figures from the manuscript can be found in the [Figures](Figures) folder.

Input data and results can be downloaded from Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10669666](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10669666).
